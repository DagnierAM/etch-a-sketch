# etch-a-sketch
The Odin Project's etch-a-sketch project. This project showcases what I have learned thus far about DOM manipulation and making my webpages dynamic.

I had a lot of fun and learned a lot throughout the life-span of this project. It is really cool having a vision and making it a reality. Being able to interact with your creation gives a pleasant accomplishing feeling and I can't wait to have this same feeling for larger more complex projects.
